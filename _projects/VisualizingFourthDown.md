Our goal in this post is to make graphs with slider interactivity using python in order to examine how fourth down decisions change based on the number of yards to go. <a href = '/projects/Fourth/matplot_pie.py'> Here </a> is the code for a pie chart that shows the breakdown of play type by yardage, using the matplotlib widget method:

<a href = '/projects/Fourth/matplot_pie.py'>
<img src = '/projects/Fourth/matplot_pie.png' style = "background:white; border: 2px solid black; width:40%; height:auto;"/>
</a>

And <a href = '/projects/Fourth/matplot_bar.py'> here </a> is the code for a bar chart that shows what happened last year when teams went for it on fourth down:

<a href = '/projects/Fourth/matplot_bar.py'>
<img src = '/projects/Fourth/matplot_bar.png' style = "background:white; border: 2px solid black; width:40%; height:auto;"/>
</a>
